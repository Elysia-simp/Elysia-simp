## Hi!

I'm Chi, Better known as Chips.

I'm just a freelance 3D artist. I decompile shaders for fun and educational purposes.


I like HoYo games, Uma musume, and *a lot* of idol games... You'll probably see a lot of this in my work.

I'm CBTDWG almost everywhere.

I don't often put my bigger projects public... But I might inclined to share something on [gist](https://gist.github.com/Elysia-simp)... If it's interesting enough


# Why MMD?

Why not? It's funny. A program from 2008 using DirectX9 doing things using modern techniques is really funny. I do use Unity though, so some of my code may provide Unity alternatives for something that is an MMD solution. <sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub><sub>Making this program my bitch is a life style at this point.</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub></sub>

<sub>But let's be for real it's not like most of these games are utilizing their renderers to their fullest potential.</sub>
